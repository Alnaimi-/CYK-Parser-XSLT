A generalised NLP parser to check if a certain sentence follows the rules of the CFG.

The parser implements the CYK algorithm. This is provided for in the parser.xsl file.

Ps. at line 312, there is a deactivated a loop, that would otherwise print all possible tree stuctures that a sentence could be formed. For instance the last sentence has 4 different possibilties.
